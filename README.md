# Luxanna

A Simple League of Legends Discord Bot
by Terrence James Diaz

## About

Luxanna is a simple bot built in NodeJS that can respond to various commands 
in your Discord server pertaining to League of Legends info retrieved from the
provided Riot API.

## Usage

A Discord bot can only be invited to a server that a user has the "Manage Server"
permissions with. 

Version 1.0.0

-*!status*
If Luxanna responds, the bot is correctly configured and online.

-*!rank [summoner-name]*
Returns the SoloQ rank of the given summoner name.

-*!level [summoner-name]*
Returns the level of the given summoner name.

## To-Do/Known Bugs

- [ ] Error handling: Currently, the bot breaks and must be restarted if a non-existent
username is given with a command. This is because the program tries to access a database
key that doesn't exist and returns an error. 
- [ ] Differentiate between ranks of different queue types.
- [ ] Add a command that tries to analyze whether a given player might be on "tilt"
- [ ] Add a command that highlights a given player's best played match in their most recent games.
- [ ] More stuff in the future
